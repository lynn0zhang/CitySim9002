IS2545 - Deliverable 2 Unit Testing
=======
My project contains 4 main java files and 3 test files.
Main Java File: Visitor, Location, Getrandom and CitySim9002
And the Test Java File: VisitorTest, GetrandomTest, CitySimTest

That's my consider of some testcase.
In CitySimTest.java, I would test whether the input is correct with our rule.
There are 4 cases, for correct input, more than one integer input, input none and input string.

First, Iâ€™ve always faced the problem that the main java file cannot find the other class in the same directory. But I can still run the project in the Netbean tool.

Also, I've met the problem that I need to generate the random number for twice, one for generating visitor and the other for generating number for location. So I combine this two in function with two size of random number.
